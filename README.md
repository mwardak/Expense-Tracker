## Summary

It is very common nowadays to make purchases with just tapping a debit/credit card which can leave the bank account with much less than what was intended for that day . Therefore, I decided to create this expense tracker to help manage daily expenses.

This is my first REACT app. I found it challenging at first but through learning and developing the app I realized I enjoy working with REACT vs Vanilla JS.  It allows the developer to organize their code via components, similar to pieces of a puzzle, each one is unique and has to be connected to the other in order for the application to run. I also liked using NPM and seeing changes to my code in real time. REACT has opened my eyes to a new way of coding and I look forward to building more apps with it.
