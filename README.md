## Summary

 This app was designed to track all expenses and help improve spending habits. Keeping a daily record of your expenses improves the financial health of your budget.

 This is my first REACT app. I found it challenging at first but through learning and developing the app I realized I enjoy working with REACT vs Vanilla JS. It allows the developer to organize their code via components, similar to pieces of a puzzle, each one is unique and has to be connected to the other in order for the application to run. I also liked using NPM and seeing changes to my code in real time. REACT has opened my eyes to a new way of coding and I look forward to building more apps with it.
